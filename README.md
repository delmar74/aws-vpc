#### How it works

**Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** gives you complete control over your virtual networking environment including resource placement, connectivity, and security.

The first step is to create your VPC. 
Then you can add resources to it, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) instances. 
Finally, you can define how your VPCs communicate with each other, across accounts, Availability Zones (AZs), or Regions. 

In this case network traffic is being shared between two VPCs within each region.
